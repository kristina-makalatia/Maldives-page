            <article> <p class="about-tekst1"> During the monsoon season from June through September, the southwest winds bring major swells to the islands –as well as surfers from all over the world. Even if you don’t surf, head to the surf breaks on the North and South Male atolls, where some of the best surfers in the world ride the swells that regularly reach up to eight feet. <br>
            If you want to learn to surf, the Maldives is an ideal place to take a lesson and hop on a board. Most beginner surfers sign up for excursions to some of the more distant atolls, where the waves aren’t quite as impressive as those in Male, but still exhilarating for new or less experienced surfers. </p>
